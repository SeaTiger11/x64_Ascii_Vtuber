# x86 Ascii Vtuber

## Project Goal
This project aims to create a 3D renderer that renders in ascii to the linux terminal. I aim to have it be able to link to a phone allowing for face tracking and have the program run a full 3d vtuber program using a custom model. 


## Disclaimer
Please note that this is my first ever x86 project and I am in the process of learning assembly, do not expect the code to be perfect however if you see anything that can be improved, I'd love to hear your feedback at my contact points down below.
